    "description": "This app holds a special place in my heart as it was the whole reason I started my tech journey. I wanted to build a free resource for other doctors who were sitting the PLAB examination after I had just written it while using a lot of different resources. It serves questions and answers and includes many features tailored towards passing the exam. It is an android application initially written in Java but converted to Kotlin, using an MVVM pattern with a firebase backend.",
